5. CPU Schedulers:
    - Determines how processes are assigned to CPU for execution
    - Maximize CPU ultilization
    - Minimize latency
    - Ensures processes are executed efficiently
    ### 3 States:
    - Ready: Process that are ready to run and waiting for CPU time
    - Running: Currently executing process
    - Blocked: Processes that are waiting for some event to complete before they can continue executing
6. Scheduling Algorithms (Diagram):

    <img src="./FCFS.png" alt="FCFS Chart" width="600" height="300">

    ### Algorithm:
    - Input the processes along with their burst time
    - Find waiting time for all processes
    - As first process that comes need not to wait so waiting time for process 1 will be 0
    - Find waiting time for all other processes, Waiting Time = (Turn Around Time â€“ Burst Time)
    - Find turnaround time = waiting time + burst time for all processes
    - Find average waiting time = total waiting time / no of processes
    - Find average turnaround time = total turn around time / no of processes
