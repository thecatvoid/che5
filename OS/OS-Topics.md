# OS Topics

## Module 1
1. OS functions:
    - Process Management
    - Memory Management
    - File System Management
    - Device Management
    - Security and Access Control
    - User Interface
    - Networking
    - Resource Allocation and Management
2. Software:
    - Collection of Programs, Instructions and Data
    - To perform specific Tasks
3. Application Software vs System Software

| Aspect          | Application Software                         |  System Software |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Directly Perform Specific Tasks for the user | Operate and Manage resources for the System |
| **Dependency**  | Dependent on System Software                 | Independent of Application Software |
| **Examples**    | Word, Excel, Chrome, Photoshop               | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Drivers |

5. Assembler:
    - Translates Assembly code to Machine code
6. Compiler:
    - Translates High level langugues into either Assembly code or Directly to Machine code
7. Interpreter:
    - Directly executes code
    - Line by line translation of code
    - Complied to bytecode sometimes

## Module 2
1. Process:
    - Series of action, steps or operations performed to achieve a specific Task
2. Process Management:
    - Managing and Handling execution of running programs or processes
    - Process Creation and Termination
    - Process Scheduling
    - Process states and transition: new, ready, waiting, running states
    - Inter-Process Communication (IPC): pipes, semaphores, shared memory
    - Process Synchronization and Concurrency: To prevent race conditions and deadlocks
    - Resource Allocation
3. Process Control Block Structure (Diagram):

| Process ID (PID)         | 
 --------------------------
| Process State            |
